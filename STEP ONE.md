# STEP ONE
## Problem Statement and Research Background: 
- The lack of funding in the fine arts, especially with regard to community music education in the Chicagoland area.
- This is partially due to poor advertising and internet presence.
- My goal is to help make a more user-friendly and aesthetically appealing website for the Music Institute of Chicago to develop a website that promotes their annual gala and the benefits of financially supporting them annually.
- Will hopefully increase donor attraction
