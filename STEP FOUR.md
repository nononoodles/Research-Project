# STEP FOUR:
## GitHub Repository Setup and Documentation
I intend to document my progress on GitHub everyday. For documentation of code I can mark what lines of code I made each day, and I can write which lessons I completed in CodeAcademy each day. I can also summarize what my new code does, and what kind of problems I faced that day.
